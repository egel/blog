Any kind of LaTeX user had to face choosing hir text editor. I choose to give a
tray of [TeXstudio][texstudio-webpage].

It has more useful features already implemented then
[texmaker][texmaker-webpage] or other software (for the date of writing this
article).

I would not bother you how to install it. It is so simple that I just skip it.
In other way I recommend you some basic setting how to improve your documents and
prevent by making some silly mistakes. Let's begin.

### Just after install
If you just installed your brand new editor then open it take a few moments to
look around. You should not notice any extraordinary into it, especially any
difference between **texmaker**.

#### What we are going to change and why?
