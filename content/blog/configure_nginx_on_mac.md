If you using your nginx configuration on mac in one file... you probably can do
it better.

Take a look how to improve your server instances by separating it into folders,
just like Apache did it with `sites-enables` and `sites-available`.

Default nginx installation didn't provide this but in few quick steps we can
achieve this.

Some example code snippets comes from [this gist][1].

### Create desired directories

  ```shell
  mkdir -p /usr/local/etc/nginx/sites-{enabled,available}
  cd /usr/local/etc/nginx/sites-enabled
  ln -s ../sites-available/default.conf
  ln -s ../sites-available/default-ssl.conf
  ```

Now some info about important file locations:

 - *nginx.conf* to `/usr/local/etc/nginx/`
 - *default.conf* and *default-ssl.conf* to `/usr/local/etc/nginx/sites-available`
 - homebrew.mxcl.nginx.plist to `/Library/LaunchDaemons/`

### Improve nginx.conf file

Probably the most important part of this snippet is last two `include` methods.

Those are enables `sites-enabled/` directory to observe every file into it. So
now you can put separate configurations for your server configurations.

> Note: You may have to create log directory if doesn't exist yet. To do so
type: `sudo mkdir -p /Library/Logs/nginx`

```nginx
#user  nobody;
worker_processes  1;

error_log  /Library/Logs/nginx/error.log;

events {
    worker_connections  1024;
}

http {
    include       mime.types;
    default_type  application/octet-stream;

    log_format  main  '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                      '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                      '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';

    access_log  /Library/Logs/nginx/access.log  main;

    sendfile        on;

    keepalive_timeout  65;

    index index.html index.php;

    upstream www-upstream-pool{
        server unix:/tmp/php-fpm.sock;
    }

    include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
    include /usr/local/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*.conf;
}
```
