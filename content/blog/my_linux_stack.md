This might be a silly topic for you, due to the programs that you use for daily jobs depend on actual person's preferences and time (mainly because in IT world application change very fast).

As a good example we can use text editors. There are so many text editors on market, that I cannot count. Someone prefers IDE like Webstorm, others like simpler version like Sublime/Atom and another group will choose Vim or Emacs.


### Text editors
-   [TeXstudio][] for very complex LaTeX things.
-   [Vim][] for everything else :)


### Music
-   [Banshee][] for GUI
-   [cmus][] for LUI

### Video
-   [VLC media player][]

### Terminal
-   [Tmux][] for
-   [Terminator][] for terminal emulator

### Misc
-   []

## Monitors and display
I am always trying to stick to `sRGB` ICC profiles to always to reach ideal colors in my monitors.

```shell
apt-get install icc-profiles # for Debian based systems

```

I also try to use [flux][] when I am not doing graphical things, to not break my day cycle while working to late hours.
