This topic has long been on my mind and in the end I wanted to share with you my reflections on one of the earliest text editors referred to, of course we talk about Vi/Vim.

I'll also try to answer some important questions:

- Is it worth it to know the Vim editor and why?
- Do you know Vim can do for me, and if so, where?
- Where to start to quickly become a Vim-iataczem?
